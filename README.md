this is basically a personalized code i made for my dad who isn't tech savy so he didn't have to buy a printer but can log all of his customers orders all within the same google sheet. and then it prevents duplicates so whoever is reading the order isnt messed up during printing and doesnt disrupt the values being entered at the same time.




the purpose of this script is to store all the inputs on the a specific file I made for my fathers company that he runs solo so he can not only be his on entry keeper while hes on the road helping customers, but it also allows him to not spend hours of inputing reciepts when he gets home after a long day of picking up orders. 

He can now get the customers information, all their items and any important informatin and it will all save to another file where his business parter his brother can save the sheet and print it at a timely manner all without disrupting the other person and it wont duplicate entries. it allows for easier team work and less time manually inputting the end of day results.
