this is basically a personalized code i made for my dad who isn't tech savy so he didn't have to buy a printer but can log all of his customers orders all within the same google sheet. and then it prevents duplicates so whoever is reading the order isnt messed up during printing and doesnt disrupt the values being entered at the same time.
